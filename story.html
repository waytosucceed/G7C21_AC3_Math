        <p>In Willowbrook Elementary, the students were tasked with creating a giant mural for the school hallway. Each group was assigned to design different sections of the mural using various four-sided shapes. As they worked, they noticed how the angles and sides of their shapes created interesting patterns and fit together in unique ways. Their teacher explained the special properties of these shapes, making the project both educational and fun.</p>

    As the mural neared completion, the students proudly observed their artwork, now understanding how parallelograms, rectangles, squares, and trapezium each had unique properties. Their teacher praised their creativity and teamwork, highlighting how they had used their knowledge of quadrilaterals to create a masterpiece. The students beamed with pride, knowing they had turned maths into a beautiful piece of art for the whole school to enjoy.
